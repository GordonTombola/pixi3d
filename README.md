# Pixi3D
Pixi3D is a JavaScript library which makes it possible to render 3D graphics on 
the web using PixiJS. Because Pixi3D is built on top of PixiJS, it plays nice 
with the already established and easy to use PixiJS API. Pixi3D works for both 
desktop and mobile web browsers and includes several components which makes it 
easy to create nice looking 3D scenes out-of-the-box:

* Load models from file or create procedural generated meshes
* Supports physically-based rendering (PBR) and image-based lighting (IBL)
* Morphing and rotation/translation/scale animations
* Create customized materials and shaders
* Built on top of the already familiar PixiJS API

## Getting started
Let's create a simple application which renders a rotating cube. Start by [getting the latest version of Pixi3D](https://github.com/jnsmalm/pixi3d/releases). Also [get an up-to-date version of PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/releases) (v5.2+) which is needed to use Pixi3D.

Next, create a file *app.js* with the following contents.

```javascript
let app = new PIXI.Application({
  backgroundColor: 0xdddddd, resizeTo: window, antialias: true
})
document.body.appendChild(app.view)

let mesh = app.stage.addChild(PIXI3D.Mesh3D.createCube())

let rotation = 0
app.ticker.add(() => {
  mesh.rotationQuaternion.setEulerAngles(0, rotation++, 0)
})
```

Then create *index.html* and include the required scripts.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="pixi.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="pixi3d.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Install with npm
Pixi3D is also available as a npm package, to install the latest release you can 
run the following command:

`npm install pixi3d --save-dev`

This requires that an up-to-date version of Node.js is already installed.

### Examples
Included with the source code is a collection of examples which shows how to use
some of the different features of Pixi3D. To be able to run the examples, 
download or clone the repository from https://github.com/jnsmalm/pixi3d and run 
*npm install*. Browse the examples inside the *examples/src* folder and run them 
using the *serve* script. For example, to run the *getting-started* application:

`npm run serve -- --env.example=getting-started`

The *serve* script can also be used for trying out Pixi3D without having to do 
any additional setup. Just create a new file i.e. *testing-feature.js* in the 
examples folder and run it with the *serve* script:

`npm run serve -- --env.example=testing-feature`

## Fundamentals
The overall goal of Pixi3D is to make it simple to render 3D graphics in a 
project which has already invested in using PixiJS (which focuses on 2D 
graphics). PixiJS is a established rendering library and contains a lot of 
functionality for making stuff easier. Such features could be loading assets, 
having a scene graph or handling user interaction. Because Pixi3D is built on 
top of PixiJS, all of those features are available in Pixi3D as well. 

Some of the concepts explained requires a basic understanding about PixiJS. For

### Transform to 3D
A core concept in PixiJS is the idea of a scene graph, that is an object 
hierarchy with parent-child relations. Containers can be created which can have 
a number of children, and those children can have children of their own and so 
on. All objects have a transform which is used to be able to set the position, 
rotation and scale of that object. The transform of an object is always relative 
to it's parent transform. That means that when moving the parent object, all of 
it's children will move as well (same goes for rotation and scaling).

The transform object in PixiJS is intended for 2D graphics, so to be able to 
transform objects in 3D a few additions and changes is needed. First is 
*position* and *scale*, which both has been extended with the z-axis.

Next is *rotation* which must be able to rotate in all three axes instead of 
just one (which is the case when using 2D). So when rotating an object in 3D, 
*rotationQuaternion* is used instead of the regular *rotation* available in 
PixiJS.

### Mesh and model
A mesh is a 3D object which can be added to the scene graph. The mesh requires 
vertex data which describes the geometry and shape of the object, but can also 
include other type of vertex information such as texture coordinates, normals 
or colors. Each mesh has a material which is used to render the mesh. A mesh can 
be created using procedural generated geometry or be a part of a model.

A model is a container for mesh objects but can also include animations for 
those meshes. Models are generally being loaded from a file which has been 
created in a 3D modeling tool like Maya or Blender. Pixi3D supports loading of 
models using the glTF file format.

> glTFâ„¢ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the 
> efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. 
> glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed 
> to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines an extensible, common publishing 
> format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows 
> and enables interoperable use of content across the industry.

### Material and shader
A material is what defines and renders the geometry of a mesh. Which material to 
use depends on the graphical requirements of the application. By creating 
customized materials, it is possible to have any desired graphical effect. A 
material uses a shader program to describe the visual output.

Shader programs are written using OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) and runs on
the GPU. The shader interprets the data of the mesh geometry and describes how 
that data should be rendered on screen. There are two types of shaders: vertex 
shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders are used to control vertex positions 
and fragment shaders are used to set the color of a pixel.
